Feature: Cache repositories
  As a lazy Vim user
  I want to cache repositories of plugins which are installed before
  So that next installation will be finished very fast

  # TODO - repositories should not be fetched.
  Scenario: Install Vim plugins with cached repositories

  # TODO - repositories should be fetched to know availability of new versions. 
  Scenario: Upgrade Vim plugins with cached repositories
